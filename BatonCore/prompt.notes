Write a typescript js file with openai lib that satisifies the following problem statement.
Ensure it works with proper tool calling.  

Assume that the "act", "extract" "observe" are from the stagehand tool.

Problem Requirements:
You are a page navgiator. You navigate the web and perform actions based on the 3 possible interfaces ("act", "extract", "observe")

You take a input and return a list of of PageFunctions. Each PageFunction is then executed in order to perform a task.
You should try to break down the given task into its atomic PageFunction.

interface PageFunction {
  name: string,
  query: string
}


Below are the following available functions and their descriptions:

// This function will return a string of the extracted content.
// query is defined to be what to extract from the webpage.
function extract(query: string)

// This function is used to perform a action on the webpage. 
// query is defined to be a prompt to perform the action.
function act(query: string)

//The observe command type identifies and analyzes webpage elements.
// Used to fetch the set of elements. 
function observe(query: string)
